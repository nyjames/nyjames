♡ Hi, I’m @nyjames, It's nice to meet you! ♡

♥ I'm an aspiring Software Engineer currently finishing my A.A.S in Computer Programming and Development @ WTCC, and a member of the National Society for Black Engineers (NSBE).

♡ In my personal time, I love music, drawing, baking and perfumery. 

♥ As of right now, I'm Working towards mastering IOS App development, and staying consistent between working on projects (full-stack, design and mini). Don't be afraid to let me know what I can do better in my projects!

♡ My Career goal is to find my first job in Software Development (Web or IOS), and a personal goal of mine is to stay consistent and complete at least one project a month.
