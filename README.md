♥ I'm an aspiring Software Engineer currently finishing my A.A.S in Computer Programming and Development @ WTCC, and a member of the National Society for Black Engineers (NSBE).

♡ In my personal time, I love music, drawing, baking and perfumery.

♥ As of right now, I'm Working towards mastering UI Design, and developing Full-stack Development Projects. Don't be afraid to let me know what I can do better in my projects!

♡ In the future, I would love to explore more into embedded systems and computer engineering.
